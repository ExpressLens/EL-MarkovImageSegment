### Description\n\nThis project focuses on image segmentation utilizing Markov random fields.\n\n### Method\n\nInitially, the program needs to understand the mean and the covariance of each class. Therefore, this is a supervised method: we should place one image for each class in a folder called "classe" at the project root. Subsequently, the program creates a random probability map. In order to find the optimal map, it undertakes a simulated annealing process. During each step of simulated annealing, the program iterates on each pixel and swaps the pixel class randomly. By determining if the new class is superior to the old one, it calculates the old cost and the new one and compares the difference. This new state will be accepted if the new cost is better and if this state respects the Metropolis algorithm.\n\n### Building\n\nThe project uses CMake build system:\n\n1. mkdir build && cd build\n2. cmake .. && make\n\n### Running\n\nIn the project root, you can find the generated executable:\n\n    ./markov input output\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* CMake (build tool)\n* OpenCV\n* Boost: filesystem\n* Armadillo\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Input\n\n![Input - example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExpressLens/EL-MarkovImageSegment/master/input/1840_paris_crop.png)\n\n#### Output\n\n![Output - example](http://ExpressLens.github.io/EL-MarkovImageSegment/output-markov.png)
